## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create a machine capable of predicting the success rate of students in a particular course by using **Machine Learning algorithms**. Our machine will be capable of predicting qualified students with the help of explanatory variables that may help in finding the accurate results based on the target variable which in our case is the success rate i.e. STATUS.
We will train our machine on past data, It will only predict qualified students based on existing data of students, and after it, we will check the accuracy of predicted data (by the machine).
